Thank you for considering to help FABRIC Jupyter Examples!  We welcome contributions in

updates, and anything else that may be helpful.  Please review these
guidelines first.

Jupyter Examples are developed on its GitHub [repository], and uses GitHub issues
and pull requests.


## Submitting Issues

If you want to add a new examples or report that something is
broken, please submit an issue via GitHub.  If you find a bug, please
describe it in enough detail so that we can quickly reproduce them.


## Submitting Pull Requests

Contributions to Jupyter Examples are made with GitHub Pull Requests. When you
submit a pull request, some tests will run against it:

- FABRIC project has a policy of requiring GPG signed commits.
  Commits on the PR branch will be checked to ensure that they are
  signed.

Most of these checks must pass before a PR is approved and merged.  We
do not tend to be excessively strict about enforcing these checks,
except the one that checks for signed commits.  Signed commits are
mandatory.

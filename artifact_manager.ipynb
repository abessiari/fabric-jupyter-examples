    "# FABRIC Artifact Manager:\n",
    "\n",
    "The FABRIC [Artifacts Manager](https://artifacts.fabric-testbed.net) is an invaluable tool for researchers and developers working with the FABRIC testbed. It facilitates the packaging, sharing, and reuse of complete, repeatable FABRIC experiments. By leveraging the FABRIC fablib, users can efficiently manage and interact with experimental artifacts in a streamlined, user-friendly manner. This not only ensures reproducibility but also enhances collaboration by making experiments easily accessible to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessing and Sharing Artifacts\n",
    "Artifacts managed through the FABRIC Artifacts Manager can be easily accessed by anyone with the appropriate permissions. Whether you're looking to share your experiment with collaborators or make your work publicly available, the Artifact Manager simplifies this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Public Artifacts**: Any user can read and download public artifacts directly from the Artifact Manager website or via the user interface generated by `ArtifactManagerUI`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Project-Specific Artifacts**: Artifacts that are tied to specific projects can also be accessed by project members, ensuring that all collaborators have easy access to the data and resources they need.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup ensures that your experiments are not only repeatable but also sharable, fostering collaboration and innovation within the research community.\n"

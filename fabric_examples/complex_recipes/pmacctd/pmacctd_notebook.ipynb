    "#  Introduction\n",
    "The FABRIC testbed is a central hub for large-scale networking experimentation and research, offering a platform for exploring innovative networking technologies. pmacct, a set of open-source passive monitoring tools by Paolo Lucente, is widely used for network traffic monitoring. Integrating pmacct into FABRIC enhances its monitoring capabilities, enabling real-time traffic analysis in an advanced research setting. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project leverages multiple technologies to develop and execute experiments, integrating pmacct into FABRIC to advance network monitoring and experimentation. The goal is to provide real-world tools and settings for computer science and engineering students to explore and innovate in networking.\n",

The aim is to create an opportunity for future students and individuals interested in networking within the field of computer science to experiment and learn by leveraging the combined capabilities of these two tools. Therefore, I encourage users to continue contributing to this notebook by modifying experiments, tweaking the pmacctd configuration files, experimenting with different topologies, incorporating pmacctd into their own projects, or simply exploring the numerous functionalities that pmacct offers."

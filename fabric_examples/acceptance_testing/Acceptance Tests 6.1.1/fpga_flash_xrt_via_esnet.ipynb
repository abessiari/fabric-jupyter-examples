    "# Functional Test 6.1.1 - Return the FPGA back to XRT golden image using ESnet tools\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook will allow you to flash the FPGA from previously flashed ONS-based state to XRT-based state. It relies on ESnet workflow dockers to do so. It should not matter which experimenter artifact the dockers are based on so long as it is valid. After the completion a cold-boot is required to return FPGA to XRT state. \n",
    "\n",
    "This procedure can be used to reset the FPGA at a given site after experiments or initialize a newly installed device if the next user wants to use XRT and not ESnet workflow. It generally follows the procedures described by [ESnet](https://github.com/esnet/esnet-smartnic-fw/blob/main/sn-stack/README.INSTALL.md#optional-remove-the-esnet-smartnic-flash-image-from-the-fpga-card-to-revert-to-factory-image) for U280 devices.

Note that unlike the [6.1.2 notebook](<../Acceptance Tests 6.1.2/fpga_flash_esnet.ipynb>) this one does not offer the ability to build ESnet docker images - if you need to do that, execute the appropriate steps in that other notebook first. \n",

    "- Step 2 Has multiple cells that initialize fablib and variables and creates a new slice\n",
    "  - The cells initializing the state __must always be executed__.\n",
    "  - Creating a slice is optional and can be skipped if slice already exists\n",
    "- Step 3 is a re-entrant cell and can be used any time you want to refresh information about the existing slice\n",
    "- Step 4 retrieves existing docker images built in Step 4 at a prior time. This is useful if you are reflashing multiple FPGAs with the same code - you can execute Step 5 once and the skip it for all further VMs simply retrieving the artifacts from Storage VM in this step\n",
    "- Step 5 that's the actual flashing and it involves identifying and rebooting the underlying server.\n",
    "- Step 6 is an optional 'extend the slice' step that can be excuted if Steps 2 and 3 have been executed.\n",

# Jupyter Examples for Fabric Testbed
Welcome to the Fabric Testbed Jupyter Examples repository! This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebook 
examples demonstrating various usage scenarios and features of the Fabric Testbed.

## About Fabric Testbed
Fabric Testbed is a platform for building and managing virtualized network environments for research, 
education, and experimentation. It provides users with access to programmable network resources, 
allowing them to create, customize, and experiment with network topologies and configurations. 
More details about the testbed can be found [here](https://portal.fabric-testbed.net/)

## What's Included
This repository includes a variety of Jupyter Notebook examples covering different aspects of the Fabric Testbed, 
including:

- Topology Creation: Examples demonstrating how to create custom network topologies using Fabric Testbed APIs.
- Configuration Management: Examples showcasing how to configure network devices and services within the Fabric Testbed environment.
- Experimentation and Analysis: Examples illustrating how to conduct experiments and analyze network performance and behavior using Fabric Testbed resources.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to create experiments on FABRIC is using JupyterHub. 
You can create your private JupyterHub environment by logging into the [FABRIC portal](https://portal.fabric-testbed.net/).

Alternatively you can set up  your local environment by following these steps:

- Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
```
git clone https://github.com/fabric-testbed/jupyter-examples.git
```
- Install Dependencies: Install the necessary dependencies to run the Jupyter Notebooks as described [here](https://learn.fabric-testbed.net/knowledge-base/install-the-python-api/). Typically, this involves installing Python and Jupyter Notebook.

- Explore the Examples: Open the Jupyter Notebooks (*.ipynb files) in your preferred Jupyter environment and explore the examples provided. Each notebook includes detailed instructions and explanations to guide you through the usage scenarios.

- Experiment and Customize: Experiment with the provided examples, modify them to suit your needs, and explore the capabilities of the Fabric Testbed platform.
